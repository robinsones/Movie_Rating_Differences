# Comparing Critic and User Movie Ratings

For my second project at [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps), I collected information on movies to try to predict differences between critic and user ratings. I was inspired by [Metacritic's post](http://www.metacritic.com/feature/movie-critics-vs-users) on this topic, where they publicized the top 20 movies that critics liked much more than users and vice versa. I wanted to go further and see if I could uncover a pattern underlying these differences.
